###Hello!
I am Steven Zuniga and I am a software developer, a very creative problem solver, and life-long learner. I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of New Mexico. Currently, I am a Student of Deep Dive Coding Camp developing my Java and Android development skills. Once I am finished I would love to find a community and workplace that will help develop my skills to become a highly productive member of any team.
